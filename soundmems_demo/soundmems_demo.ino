Date: December 2017

These sound reactive demos are based on Mark Kriegsman's demoreel00 format.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

The Sparkfun MEMS microphone SHOULD be powered with 3.3V. If you do so, you need to connect the 3.3V line to the AREF pin on your Arduino.

Furthermore, you will need to uncommment the following line in setup:

//  analogReference(EXTERNAL);                                                    // Comment out this line for 3.3V Arduino's, ie. Flora, etc.

If you power your microphone from 5V or are using a 3.3V Arduino, such as a Flora, etc, then leave the line commented out.


Features:

- 10, count 'em 10 different sound reactive demos.
- Broken out functionality into separate .h files for readability.
- Only ONE delay statement in the setup. That's it. Delay statements should be avoided at all costs.
- Uses a variable rate EVERY_N_MILLISI() function instead.
- Trying to localize and tighten up the variable definitions as much as possible.
- Uses the 3.3V Sparkfun MEMS microphone with a whopping 67 dba gain.
- Uses a potentiometer to adjust sensitivity.
- Uses FastLED palette, palette transitioning, beats, fast math as well as perlin noise functionality.
- No floating point math. I use 8 or 16 bit for better performance.


Not features:

- Not object oriented.
- Not passing variables or structs to/from functions.
- Sorry, but I prefer Java style curly brackets and not C style. Maybe that's because I don't use a real IDE.

Notes:

- Comment out the analogreference(EXTERNAL) if using a 3.3V Arduino
- This requires a potentiometer to adjust sensitivity.
- This runs at about 430 loops per second on an Arduino Nano with 60 APA102's. Do NOT add delay statements or I will find you . . .
- This probably won't scale beyond 255 LED's.
